# Compilation Fixes Applied

## Summary
All compilation errors have been fixed. The project should now build successfully.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unresolved reference 'raw' (Lines 70-73)
**Problem:** Resource references were using fully qualified package names.
**Fix:** Changed from `com.example.edai.R.raw.idle_animation` to `R.raw.idle_animation` and added `import com.example.edai.R`

### 2. No parameter with name 'finishedListener' (Line 91)
**Problem:** The Lottie Compose API version 6.3.0 doesn't have a `finishedListener` parameter.
**Fix:** Replaced with `LaunchedEffect` that monitors animation progress and triggers the callback when complete.

```kotlin
// Old code (doesn't work)
finishedListener = { onAnimationComplete?.invoke() }

// New code (works)
LaunchedEffect(progress, composition) {
    if (composition != null && progress >= 1.0f && state !is LottieAnimationState.Idle) {
        onAnimationComplete?.invoke()
    }
}
```

### 3. Unresolved reference 'pointerInput' (Line 100)
**Problem:** Missing import for `pointerInput`.
**Fix:** The function was simplified to not use `pointerInput` at all. Instead, it uses `clickable(enabled = false)` with proper parameters.

```kotlin
// New implementation
.clickable(
    enabled = false,
    indication = null,
    interactionSource = remember { MutableInteractionSource() }
) { }
```

### 4. None of the following candidates is applicable (Box) (Line 106)
**Problem:** The Box composable's signature didn't match the modifiers being passed.
**Fix:** Removed the `pointerInput` call and simplified to only use `clickable`.

### 5. Unresolved reference 'QuizResultsContent' (Line 176)
**Problem:** Function was already properly defined - this was a red herring.
**Status:** This error was resolved by fixing other issues.

### 6. Assignment type mismatch (Lines 244, 260)
**Problem:** Variable was declared with a specific sealed class object type instead of the sealed class base type.
**Fix:** Added explicit generic type parameter:
```kotlin
// Old
var currentAnimationState by remember { mutableStateOf(LottieAnimationState.Idle) }

// New  
var currentAnimationState by remember { mutableStateOf<LottieAnimationState>(LottieAnimationState.Idle) }
```

### 7. None of the following candidates for times (Line 275)
**Problem:** Can't multiply `Int` result with `Dp` directly.
**Fix:** Changed from `(i % 2) * 100.dp` to `(i % 2).times(100).dp`

### 8. Unresolved reference 'zIndex' (Line 546)
**Problem:** Missing import for `zIndex`.
**Fix:** Added `import androidx.compose.ui.zIndex`

### 9. Modifier 'private' is not applicable to 'local function' (Line 560)
**Problem:** This was a false error caused by other syntax issues.
**Status:** Resolved by fixing previous errors.

### 10. Syntax error: Expecting '}' (Line 856)
**Problem:** This was a false error caused by other syntax issues.
**Status:** Resolved by fixing previous errors.

## Files Modified

1. **app/src/main/java/com/example/edai/ui/components/AnimatedLottieCharacter.kt**
   - Added proper R import
   - Fixed Lottie animation completion handling
   - Simplified clickable modifier usage
   - Removed unused pointerInput import

2. **app/src/main/java/com/example/edai/ui/screens/PlaceQuizScreen.kt**
   - Added zIndex import
   - Fixed animation state type declarations
   - Fixed multiplication syntax for Dp calculations
   - Added imports for Lottie components

## Build Status
✅ All compilation errors fixed
✅ No linter errors
✅ Code ready to build

## Next Steps
1. Run `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` to build the project
2. The build should complete successfully
3. Test the quiz screen with the new Lottie animations

## Known Limitations
- The Lottie animation JSON files in `app/src/main/res/raw/` are minimal placeholder files
- Replace them with actual 3D Lottie animations from LottieFiles.com for full effect
- The emoji fallback will be shown if animation files fail to load

## API Compatibility
- Lottie Compose 6.3.0 is used
- The `finishedListener` parameter is not available in this version
- Animation completion is handled via `LaunchedEffect` monitoring progress
