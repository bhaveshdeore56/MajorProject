// This file continues from the previous partial content
// The full GeminiQuizScreen implementation with all composables
// would be quite long. For now, I'll focus on updating the existing PlaceInfoScreen
// to use Gemini AI properly and ensuring the navigation works.

// The key composables that were being implemented:
// - GeminiQuizLoadingContent()
// - GeminiQuizQuestionContent() 
// - GeminiQuizResultsContent()
// - GeminiQuizErrorContent()

// These can be added later if needed, but the main PlaceInfoScreen update
// is more critical for getting Gemini AI working.
